# Open Visualization Collaboration Space

The Open Visualization Collaboration Space “OpenVis” is a forum within the OpenJS Foundation to neutrally govern comprehensive and widely adopted visualization libraries based on JavaScript and WebGL.

Members of OpenVis help other developers, data scientists, and visualization specialists improve GPU-accelerated visualization software. We do this through an open governance model that encourages participation and technical contribution, and by providing a framework for long term stewardship by a variety of stakeholders. Check out [our membership page](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/openvis-collab-space/blob/main/join.md) if you're interested in becoming a member.

We welcome contributors and collaborators to get involved through OpenJS at any time. Learn more on [our contribution page](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/openvis-collab-space/blob/main/contribute.md). Contributors may also participate in the OpenJS Foundation’s technical governance body, the Cross Project Council, regardless of membership status.

## Mission Statement

Openly develop transformative, high performance visualization frameworks for the web.

## This Repository
The purpose of this repository is to provide a central place for coordination and documentation around visualization practices and resources for the JavaScript community.
