# Open Visualizatoin Collaboration Space

The Open Visualization Collaboration Space “OpenVis” is a forum within the OpenJS Foundation to neutrally govern the most comprehensive and widely adopted visualization libraries based on JavaScript and WebGL.

The Open Visualization Collaboration Space is a forum within the OpenJS Foundation to neutrally govern the most comprehensive and widely adopted visualization libraries based on JavaScript and WebGL.

Open Visualization Space helps developers, data scientists, visualization specialists and engineers to improve development of high performance GPU visualization solutions. We do this through an open governance model that encourages participation and technical contribution, and by providing a framework for long term stewardship by a variety of stakeholders.

Open Visualization is a part of the OpenJS Foundation. We welcome contributors and collaborators to get involved through OpenJS at any time. Contributors may participate in the OpenJS Foundation’s technical governance body, the Cross Project Council, regardless of membership status.
